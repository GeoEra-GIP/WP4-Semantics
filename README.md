# Background

[GIP-P](https://geoera.eu/projects/gip-p/) WP4 initiates, designs, tests the development of vocabulary data within the framework of the EGDI portal which is to support GeoERA projects. This includes suggestions for a technical infrastructure for sustainable data storage, the organization of governance and maintenance of the vocabularies, as well as the technical possibilities of coding data sets with vocabulary (e.g. within the EGDI metadata catalogue). The supported use cases are “Multilingual Semantic Text Search” (=> [Keyword Thesaurus](https://github.com/GeoEra-GIP/WP4-Semantics/tree/master/Keyword%20Thesaurus)) and “Expert Vocabularies” (=> [Project Vocabularies](https://github.com/GeoEra-GIP/WP4-Semantics/tree/master/Project%20Vocabularies)) to code GeoERA project data with Linked Data concepts.
