# GeoERA Project Vocabularies
Project vocabularies provide the opportunity to clarify expert knowledge and terminology in the form of project specific vocabulary concepts on a scientific level and to use them in datasets to code data. At the same time, parts of this vocabulary might be later included in international standards (e.g. INSPIRE or GeoSciML), if desired. By comparison, Project vocabularies are open collections of knowledge that, for example, may also contain deprecated, historical or only regionally relevant terms. In an ideal overall view, the sum of all Project vocabularies results in a knowledge database of bibliographically referenced terms that have been developed through scientific projects. Due to the consistent application of the data standards of Semantic Web and Linked Data nothing stands in the way of further use by modern technologies such as AI. The report explains what is meant by Project vocabularies in the context of GeoERA and examples of what problems, in semantics of data, can be solved by using them. In addition, project related methods and workflows around Linked Data, and SKOS in particular, are described.
